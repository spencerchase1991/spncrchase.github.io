                                            Hi, my name is Spencer! I was born in Fruita, Colorado, January 17, 1991. I have two Razor Edge Pitbulls that take up the whole bed. I would love to tell you that I take full advantage of living in a state full of adventure, but I do not! I have a huge family and love every minute of it. Minus Christmas shopping and remembering birthdays!! We are all very close and we love trying new food and drinks.
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                             Graduated in 2009 from Parker, Colorado and spent most of my early 20's serving tables and having fun! Right after my 24th birthday, I landed a receptionist job at The Society for Mining Metallurgy and Exploration. Quickly moved my way up to the IT department, where I worked under two Senior developers and became intrigued with their knowledge of code.

                                      <p>
                                             My hopes are to see the world. I believe Coding and Web Development will allow me to do just that. I am excited to see where this career will take me in life!!
